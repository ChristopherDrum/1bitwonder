#One Bit Wonder
A back-to-basics approach to image compression for the Pico-8. Uses 4-bit color to collapse 4 1-bit image planes into a single image. With a simple palette swap we can display any image from any bitplane trivially using the Pico-8 SPR and SSPR commands. Created for, and in use by, [Mystery House (Remodeled)](https://github.com/ChristopherDrum/mystery_house_remodeled/)
